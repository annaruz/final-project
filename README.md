# final-project
This is a consolidation project for some of the things that I have learned in my Composing Digital Media course! For this project, I am building on my knowledge of website creation with the use of HTML and CSS and photo design through the platform GIMP. I am making a website and logo for a made-up daycare, Caring Casa. In its current preview state, I have four HTML pages (index, about, events, and contact) as well as one CSS stylesheet. All repurposed assets are listed in my assets.md file in this repository.
