# final-project
This is a consolidation project for some of the things that I have learned in my Composing Digital Media course! For this project, I am building on my knowledge of website creation with the use of HTML and CSS and photo design through the platform GIMP. To culminate my learning, I have created a website and logo for a made-up daycare, Caring Casa. I have five HTML pages (index, about, admission, events, and contact) as well as one CSS stylesheet. There are also screenshots included to show my progress throughout the various stages of the project. All repurposed assets are listed in my assets.md file in this repository. Enjoy!
